		<p>
			To get the most out of your experience at the GHCDC we highly
			recommend preparing for this event. Listed below are some resources to
			get you started.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also will have an official slack channel for you to join to ask
			questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this competition you should assume that you will be walking into a
			mixed OS environment. The OS could be Windows, Linux, or OpenBSD. It is
			therefore imperative to be familiar with their intricacies, software that
			can be run on them, common vulnerabilities and how to harden the
			systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			For an introduction into the Linux Command Line please check out this 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Codecademy resource</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have completed that I highly recommend doing the secure server
			challenge here: secure server challenge
		</p>
		<p>
			As for windows if you have access to windows ISO I would play around
			with them and windows server, and not just the new versions and
			releases.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would also look up some of the tools that are going to be used against
			you such as meterpreter and how to detect and defend against.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the end of the day, this competition is set up for every blue team to
			be owned. Your job is to be owned the least and **Keep your services
			up**
		</p>
		<p>
			Good Luck!
